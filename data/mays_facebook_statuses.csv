The 10 Days campaign this fall is a 10-day period during which all members of the Aggie family are encouraged to only drink water, and donate the money that would have been spent on other beverages to drill water wells in Rwanda. Last year, more than $50,000 was raised. This year's goal is even larger - $1 for every student enrolled at Texas A&M.

8461306214_10154012977211215,"Hello everyone!

Odyssey has a paid internship opportunity for the self-motivated, entrepreneurial minded members of the College Station community with Odyssey's executive sales team.

We are interested in speaking with motivated incoming Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors that will be on campus this summer. Our interns must be willing to learn and willing to work extremely hard. A form of reliable transportation is highly recommended. Sales, Business, Advertising, Marketing, Communications & PR majors are preferred. Our sales execs must be able to work 35-40 hours/week over the summer. Our internship will not conflict with any summer school.

This is not your 'typical internship' - as a member of our Campus Sales Executive Team, this position provides training, systems, and continuous coaching to actually run a business on campus. In addition to the leadership and entrepreneurial skills you will develop, this position also provides real-world experience in the full sales cycle, sales pipeline management, marketing, business development and operations.

Many of our past interns have gone on to top level companies such as HSBC, Bank of America, Facebook, and Deloitte or founded their own successful companies such as Ellison Sunglasses.

I'm sure you have seen plenty of articles shared by writers you may know on Facebook, but learn some more about us here:

8461306214_10107786281715904,"Okay! It is time to vote to keep a Mays School former student Number One! Hello Ms. Brenckman,
On behalf of the 2015 International Brand Master Award Committee, I want to offer our sincere congratulations on being nominated for the 2015 International Brand Master Award. Please read the entire email as information for future participation is included.

You are among a select group of eight accomplished and dedicated professionals in education marketing who have been identified for recognition by your peers.  This year’s nominees represent an extraordinary group of marketers from a variety of different institutions throughout the world.

A volunteer, blue-ribbon judging panel independently reviewed and scored each nomination according to a rigorous set of judging guidelines and based on the materials and supporting documentation submitted on behalf of each nominee.  This six-member panel of independent judges included the following highly accomplished professionals (alphabetical order by last name):
Elizabeth Allen: Director of Online Communication at the American School in London in London, United Kingdom
Jennifer Collins: Grants Administrator at SEAL Legacy Foundation in Virginia, United States
Eilis O’Brien: Director of Communication and Marketing at University College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland
Seth Odell: 2013 International Brand Master Winner and Vice President of Creative and Marketing Strategy at Helix Education in Utah, United States
Dr. David Peck: 2014 International Brand Master Winner and Vice President of University Relations at Azusa Pacific University in California, United States
Kay Zimmerman: Associate Vice Provost Marketing & Partnership Development and Special Assistant to the Senior Vice President for Academic Outreach & Entrepreneurship at North Carolina State University DELTA
Travis Brock: Chair of the 2015 International Brand Master Award committee, and Director of Business Development and Social Media for Educational Marketing Group, Inc. (replacement judge)
More about each of the distinguished judges will be available at http://emgonline.com/ibm-award/past-awards/2015-master/#2015-judges (available soon).

Below are the three finalists and the judges’ scores for each, including a brief description of the judging rationale.  Judges scored materials submitted by the nominators (nomination questionnaire), nominees (nominee questionnaire), and third-party supporters (letters of support) for each of the nominees. Each judge completed a score sheet for each nominee worth 50 points.  Scores represent the sum of all six judges scores.  A total of 300 points was possible. To keep judging fair and objective, Travis Brock was a replacement judge when deemed necessary. More on the scoring process: http://emgonline.com/ibm-award/about-the-award/.

Between now and 6pm EST on Friday March 11, 2016, professional colleagues, staff, faculty, students and stakeholders from around the world are invited to vote for their choice from among the three finalists via social media. For further assistance, please read this blog regarding brand mobilization and the International Brand Master Award http://emgonline.com/blog/2011/02/mobilizing-a-brand/.   The winner will be determined by combining the votes with the judges’ scores, and will be announced the week of March 21, 2016.

We encourage you, your colleagues, and brand stakeholders to participate in the voting process beginning today, Monday February 29, by visiting the voting website http://emgonline.com/ibm-award/past-awards/2015-master/#2015-finalists (available soon).  You are welcome to spread the word and vote, as well. We will update you on the total vote count halfway through the process and will not provide incremental and individual updates. Links are also available on the voting websites to monitor the voting process.

Nomination for this award represents a professional recognition of which you should be justly proud.  We at EMG, the judging panel, and the award committee again offer our heartfelt congratulations to you for your well-deserved recognition by peers and colleagues.

We wish you continued success.

The top three scoring individuals and finalists for the 2015 International Brand Master Award include:
With 268 points: Shelly Brenckman, Marketing Coordinator, Texas A&M University Startup Aggieland in Texas, United States
With 208.5 points: Johanna Lowe, Head of Marketing, Communications, and Engagement, University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia
With 208 points: Marianna Chico, Director of Communications, The Bishop Strachan School in Ontario, Canada
NOTE:   Judges independently and separately scored the same materials and background documentation for each nominee.  Scores represent the sum of all judges’ scores.  A total of 300 points was possible. See http://emgonline.com/ibm-award/about-the-award/ for more information on the scoring process.

Judges Notes Based on the Materials Submitted to Support Your Nomination:
So often in higher education we hear about small teams with limited resources facing significant challenges. Shelly is proof that with passion, persistence, and strong attention to brand marketing it is possible to achieve great things. Her work has proven to be a powerful extension of the A&M brand and not only has introduced the world to Startup Aggieland, but has further elevated the university's brand in the process. It's impressive stuff.
Shelly's work is extraordinary, serving as a model for new venture entrepreneurship. The creative is clean, consistent, on-brand, clear, innovative and all encompassing. Shelly inspires students to live their dreams, and puts her passion into helping them to be successful.
Startup Aggieland is an excellent example of initiative marketing and Shelly is to be commended for her enthusiasm in driving and promoting the spirit of entrepreneurship embodied in the initiative.  However, while I get the use of the “Aggieland” alma mater reference, it’s not a great brand for promoting startups.  This makes it difficult to ‘work the brand’.  In this campaign, I hear lots of people talking – as is often the case with entrepreneurship – but real brand success is based on measures.  Having said this, I find Shelly’s work most engaging; it draws you in deeper and deeper and that in itself is success.
Shelly's depth and breadth of strategic thinking as well as tactical initiatives sets her apart as a candidate for this award. Her innovative thinking and commitment to her university - as well as the profession - is exemplary.
Good luck and we look forward to receiving votes!

Please let me know if you have any questions,
Travis

8461306214_10153687839061215,"Sixth-graders from Bryan ISD’s Odyssey Academy visited Mays Business School Tuesday for the second day of Freshman Business Initiative’s project presentations.

Henry Musoma’s FBI students presented posters in the Wehner atrium that depicted their semester-long research on how certain global issues relate to business. Richard Johnson’s students presented posters Monday.

The students worked in teams to research a specific global issue and find ways that a specific major of business – finance, marketing, supply chain, etc. – might address the issue. The presentations ranged from Health and Healthcare in South Africa to Coronary Heart Disease in Panama to Transportation in Brazil.

“I didn’t realize that many countries had so much problems,” said sixth-grader Reagan Barker, who was one of dozens of students from the STEM magnet program at Stephen F. Austin Middle School.

Musoma arranged the visit as an outreach to the community, to enhance the younger students’ understanding of global issues and business and empower them to reach their fullest potential and set college as a viable goal.

“You can see everything click in their heads,” said Mays freshman Reagan Brown, who partnered with freshman Carmen Guzman to present “The Poverty Problem” about poverty in Canada. “It’s really interesting to see how much they understand about the topic,” Brown said.

Guzman added: “It’s amazing to come here and work with these kids. They even taught me some things.”",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/maysbusiness/photos/a.10150414087201215.411819.8461306214/10153687839061215/?type=3,2015-11-17 17:38:05,20,0,2

8461306214_265678070189339,"Howdy Aggies!
I am a Junior Management major at Texas A&M University. I just recently started an organization called St. Baldrick's at TAMU and we are nationally affiliated with the St. Baldrick's Foundation. The St. Baldrick's Foundation is the second leading fundraiser for childhood cancer research, with the US government being the first. The St. Baldrick's Foundation is a volunteer driven organization and provides supplies and mentors to people such as myself who wish to host a St. Baldrick's Event. A St. Baldrick's event entails obtaining participants or, Shavees, who have committed to shaving their heads in solidarity for children with cancer. The shavees then obtain money from friends and family to shave their heads. I am currently looking for participants, volunteers, corporate sponsorships/partnerships/or matching, silent auction items, and food for the event.

Our event will be held on April 27, 2012 from 3:00-8:00 PM at Schotzis in College Station. We will have a band, Silent Auction, food and drinks, and the head shaving ceremony. We will be honoring my brother, Peter, who is cancer free as of February 14, 2012 and another boy Alex, who was just recently diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma.

Our goal is 15,000 dollars and we are currently at 5,155! If you are interested in participating as a volunteer or a shavee please let me know or sign up online at http://www.stbaldricks.org/events/mypage/7997/2012.

Be a part of Texas A&M Kiva and it will give you an opportunity to fund people around the world by lending out money.

What is Kiva?
Kiva is essentially a microfinance organization and A&M Campus Kiva is a student chapter of Kiva. It lends money to people in poor countries( who are entrepreneurs and do not have credit history to get money from the bank) and the money is repaid back to you at a repayment rate of 99.7% in six months! It is an awesome concept.

To show show your support towards microfinance/ Kiva/ if you want to loan please join the Texas A&M team for free here, it takes 30 seconds: http://www.kiva.org/team/tamu_campus_kiva
